# Telco-Churn-Prediction
The Telco customer churn data set was used for this prediction exercise. The data had 7,043 observations and 21 variables. Three prediction models were explored: Logit, SVM, and GBM.
A t-test evaluation was conducted to test the null hypothesis that there was no difference between the models. The results of the test showed that none of the three models had a superior accuracy over the other. However, the Logit model appeared to perform better the other two on basis of its Kappa statistic.
